# MultiprocessVisualizer
## Description
A short python script to calculate Julia fractals and visualise the asynchron nature of the multiprocessed calculations using opencv. The code for actually calculating the julia-fractal was taken from [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/julia-fractal-python/) tutorial.
